Try to solve the problem by **greedy choices**. \
Always make a choice that looks best at the moment $\implies$ hope that it (**locallly optimal choice**) leads to a **global optimal solution**.

## Greedy algorithms
To yield an optimal solution by taking greedy choices, the problem should exhibit two key properties:
- **Greedy-choice property**: A global optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal (greedy) choice.  
- **Optimal substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.
